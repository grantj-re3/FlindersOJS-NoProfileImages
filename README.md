# FlindersOJS-NoProfileImages

## Purpose

Prevent OJS v3 users from uploading images within their user-profile via:
- Profile > Public tab > Profile Image
- Profile > Public tab > Bio Statement upload
- Profile > Contact tab > Signature upload
- Profile > Contact tab > Mailing Address upload

The principle has been verified for OJS versions:
- 3.1.2.4
- 3.2.0.3
- 3.3.0.5
